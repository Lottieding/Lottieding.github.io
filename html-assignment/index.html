        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi, I'm Cong Ding, this is my 1 <sup>st</sup> year in Canada. Welcome to my site.</p>

        <p> I'm an avid anime enthusiast who can spend hours immersed in the vibrant and imaginative worlds of animated storytelling.
            A cold Coke in hand and a pack of potato chips by my side, I find pure joy in these simple pleasures.
            Despite havng social phobia, I've learned to embrace my love for indoor activities, creating a space where my favorite shows and snacks help me unwind and be myself.</p> 
            
        <p> When it comes to downtime, you will likely find me at home, engrossed in the latest anime release.
            Coke and potato chips are my loyal companions during these moments, turning my personal space into a haven of relaxation.
            Dealing with social phobia has led me to appreciate the comfort of my own company, where I can truly be at ease,
            enjoying the things that brrng me happiness.</p>
